## Usage

### Fetching Assets

To fetch assets, simply run:

```bash
cld-get-assets go
```

Follow the prompts to enter your Cloudinary credentials and other settings.

#### Step 1: Enter Cloudinary Credentials

You'll be prompted to enter your Cloudinary credentials:

- Cloudinary cloud name
- Cloudinary API key
- Cloudinary API secret

These credentials will be saved for future use.

#### Step 2: Choose Output Directory and Filename

Next, you'll be asked to specify:

- The output directory where the CSV will be saved. It's relative to your current working directory.
- The filename for the CSV

#### Step 3: Choose Additional Fields

You'll have the option to include additional fields in the CSV:

- Tags
- Metadata

Use the arrow keys to select which fields you want to include.

#### Step 4: Choose Metadata Fields (Optional)

If you chose to include metadata, you'll be prompted to select which metadata fields to include in the CSV. Again, use the arrow keys to make your selections.

#### Step 5: Fetching and Saving

After you've made all your selections, the tool will fetch the assets based on your criteria and save them to a CSV file in the specified directory.

## Configuration

The tool saves your Cloudinary credentials locally for future use. The config file is saved at:

:open_file_folder: ~/.cld_get_assets_config.json

To update saved Cloudinary credentials, run:

```bash
